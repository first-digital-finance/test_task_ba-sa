# Test Task for Business/System Analyst Position

## Problem

ABC Bank has to develop an Android application for client onboarding, with no other onboarding channels.

In this application, customers are required to provide the following mandatory information:

* Full Name
* Date of Birth
* International Passport Details (including scanned copy)
* Selfie
* Contact Information (mobile phone number and email address)
* Access to Contacts

The application must collect this information, including all contacts from the user's address book, and send this data to the backend system. Upon receiving this data, the backend system is responsible for making a decision to either reject or approve the client. Additionally, the system should determine and set a credit limit for the approved client.

A special user group called "Credit Control" should have the capability to view random client applications and verify the correctness of the decisions made.

## Solution

As a Business/System Analyst (BA/SA), your role is to thoroughly analyze the business requirements and provide a detailed description of the process. In this task, we expect the following from you:

1. Prepare a list of questions for clarifications, if needed.
2. Make assumptions where necessary and provide answers to these questions.
3. Describe the processes based on your assumptions. The process description should include a graphical representation (preferably BPMN) and text descriptions for specific steps, as required.
4. Create a data model for this system.

## Notes

* The business requirements provided are at a high level; please consider the details and make necessary assumptions to extend the data model
* Do not limit your analysis to the happy path; account for various scenarios and potential issues in your process description
